      <img src="assets/images/profile.jpg" class="auth-image" alt="Your Name">

      <p>Who am I ? This is the essential question that I ask myself as well. Well that question could depend on how you would like to know me. Superficially one can see that I am Asian. Specifically, Korean. Place of birth, is not Korea - but Flushing, New York, USA. First born child and only son to my mother Sung Nan Shin and father Hai Seung Shin. I have two younger sisters, named Miso and Naomi.</p>

      <p>Currently employed at Hyundai Mobis as a Quality Assurance Assistant Manager for Warranty and Claims Improvement department. However, I am seeking out a new venture through web development. I am learning to code and hope to get better as time progresses. </p>
